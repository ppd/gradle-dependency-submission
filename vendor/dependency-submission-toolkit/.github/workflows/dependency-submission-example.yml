      # As of 2023-02-22, the ubuntu-latest image uses npm v8.3.1. This version
      # has a bug that prevents loading dependency-submission-toolkit in the
      # 'example/' project. npm v8.4.1 (same version in Codespace created on
      # same date) is known to work. Not pinned to latest to avoid
      # reproducibility issues.
